/// Dart Libraries & Imports

/// Use `import` to specify how a namespace from one library 
/// is used in the scope of another library.

/// For example, Dart web apps generally use the `dart:js_interop` library, 
/// which they can import like this:
/// `import 'dart:js_interop';`

/// The only required argument to `import` is a URI specifying the library. 
/// For built-in libraries, the URI has the special `dart:` scheme. 
/// For other libraries, you can use a file system path or the `package:` scheme.
 
/// The `package:` scheme specifies libraries provided by a package manager 
/// such as the pub tool. For example:
/// `import 'package:test/test.dart';`

/// [URI] stands for uniform resource identifier. 
/// [URLs] (uniform resource locators) are a common kind of URI.

void main() {  
  print('Hello, Dart!');
