## What will you find here?

### Structured learning  

- Basic syntax and structures (e.g. `variables/`, `control-flow/`, `functions/`)

- Object-oriented programming (e.g. `classes-&-objects/`)
- Higher-order functions, collections, and types (e.g. `loops/`, `branches/`, `types/`)
- Asynchrony (e.g. `async/await`, `Future` and `Stream`)
- Null safety and best practices (e.g. `null-safety/`, `effective-dart/`)
- Folder: [`language/`](./language/)

### Personal tests 
- Free experimentation with new concepts

- Useful or curious code snippets
- Brief notes on language behaviors
- Folder: [`playground/`](./playground/)

### Programming challenges 
- Solutions to exercises and challenges proposed by the **Spanish-speaking community** (by [mouredev](https://retosdeprogramacion.com/roadmap/))

- Translated statements (if necessary) and my own explanations
- Folder: [`retos-de-programacion/`](./retos-de-programacion/)

### Experimental modules 
- Classes and functions as interchangeable pieces

- Importable experimental scripts
- Folder: [`my-modules`](./my-modules/)

### Data structures  
- Development patterns will help me improve **programming logic**  

- Practical implementations of structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.  
- Exercises to strengthen computational thinking  
- Folder: [`data-structures/`](./data-structures/)  

## Repository goals

- Consolidate my knowledge of **Dart** from the ground up

- Prepare myself to develop with **Flutter** more confidently
- Learn by solving **real** problems and applying what I’ve learned
